## General info
* version 0.1.6
* started learning : 25 march 2021
* Attempt 6 started again on April 2nd


## Game Description:
the game is really random, and still not completed. You play as a cat collect coins that might be changed to mouse and place them into a chest using the E key.
using the count +=1 ( ive been having a hard time with the get_tick) when the count reaches 100 there is a 90% chance a thief will spawn and paths toward the chest to steal if he stole there is no way for the player to get the points back even after they kill him. There are 3 buffs future 4th one will come soon player has health and energy bar, movement costs energy if 0 energy the game name Evade now doesnt make sense so a new one will come

## Incomplete:
* better visuals
* score saved!
* add a mob that tries to kill the player ( not steal)
* menu screen missing option and stats

## ideas:
* start making my own pixel art
* change coin to paw or mouse (make sense)
* maybe change the layout to a town ?? and the chest is basically a bank ?


## Issues:
* chest animation doesnt work for the player only
